        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I’m Thanatos, also known as Thottysploity. Currently, I’m pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Cyber Security. My insatiable curiosity for hacking has led me on a path of exploration and learning. I specialize in exploit development, post-exploitation techniques like lateral movement, active directory exploitation, and firmware exploitation.</p>
<p>As a security researcher, I’m devoted to helping the cyber community defend themselves against malicious hackers driven by financial gain or the desire to cause harm. Notably, during my first year as a bachelor’s student, I achieved a significant milestone by creating a Proof-of-Concept for a Rust version of Mimikatz, now known as mimikatz-rs.</p>
<p>What makes my journey even more remarkable is that I embarked on it at the age of 11, teaching myself everything I know about cybersecurity. From that young age, I’ve been driven by self-motivation and a thirst for knowledge.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that a strong foundation of self-learning and personal growth is essential in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. While pursuing my bachelor’s degree, I continuously seek practical experiences and conduct independent research to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and emerging threats.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my passion for cybersecurity, which started at a young age and has been entirely self-taught, has shaped me into a dedicated security researcher. I’m committed to expanding my knowledge, contributing to the community, and ensuring a safer digital world for all.</p>
